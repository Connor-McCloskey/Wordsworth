Jupiter
By Malcolm Guite

I
Come fill the cup and let the fountain flow
Your king has come! There is a feast to keep
With kindled eyes and faces all aglow
Come fill the cup.

There is a joy that makes the spirt leap
And makes the humble greater than they know.
You break the bread, the wine is at your lip,

Rich music stirs your spirit, solemn, slow
Whose true nobility still draws you up
Beyond your self with blesseings to bestow.
Come, fill the cup.

II
Come fill the cup, whether you will or no,
For the Great Leader, you will drink it up.
His grateful people must put on a show.
Come fill the cup

Or you and yours will suffer. One false step
And someone disappears. They say below
His banquet hall the tortured cry for help

But Death, delaying, comes to them too slow.
So you must march and cheer and make things up.
That you may drown the truth you should not know
Come, fill the cup.
