I'm doing well, how are you?
I'm feeling a bit under the weather, actually!
I'm okay. How are you?
Good, busy writing poetry.
Can't talk, I'm wrestling Randy Savage.
I'm digging this new Billie Eilish album.
I'm terrible. Just terrible. How are you?
Nature is, like, awesome, dude.
Amazing! How are you?
You know, I'm getting really tired of your questions...
I'm reveling in the work of this new writer, Connor McCloskey, you should check him out...
Can't talk, I'm wrestling a bear.
Life needs things to live.
Who bought these olives? They're terrible!
Wakka wakka!
Coleridge can blow me.
I've been better. How are you?
I'm okay...wait...what is that smell?! Is that you?!
Hey! I'm doing well!
I'm doing awesome! What's new in your life?
Give Connor all your money I MEAN great, what's new with you?
Can you believe these gas prices?!
I'm alright. I lost all my money on the stock market today. Guess I shouldn't have invested in novelty apiaries.
It's cold where I am! How are you?
It's hot where I am! How are you?
Just considering the wonders of being alive.
Just contemplating the wonders of nature.
It's a beautiful day. I couldn't be better!
