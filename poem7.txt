The Moon
By Malcolm Guite

I
The moon is full and snow falls soft tonight
In silver filigree. I seem to fall,
Floating through the chapel of her light,
The moon is full.

The white lace of the snowfall makes a veil
Through which I glimpse her face, a paler white,
Whose pallor calls to me, a tidal pull

That gatheres in me, loosens, lifts the weight
That palls and pulls me. In her light I feel
Fasted and lifted, empty, open, light,
The moon is full.

II
The moon is full and I have lost my way,
Drawn down her mazy path towards my fall,
Ready to swoon and sink beneath her sway,
The moon is full.

The tide of panic rises and I feel
A dark fear that deletes the light of day.
Her pale light wraps around me like a pall

That pulls and blurs and blends and wipes away
And drains the patterns from my mind, until
She empties me and I can only say
The moon is full
