Mars
By Malcolm Guite

I
Rise up and stand for what you know is right,
Marshal your strength and take the upper hand,
Be braced and ready in the morning light
Rise up and stand.

The trumpet calls through the bright martial band
To rouse the brave and free with sound and sight,
The red rose kindles to a flaming brand

When Love needs her defenders. Though the night
Is long and dark, deliverance is at hand!
So, battle-hardened, fearless in the fight,
Rise up and stand.

II
Rise up and stand to grasp with iron will
The spoils of war, the conquest of the land.
Whilst there is war to wage and blood to spill
Rise up and stand.

Although the ground you gain is red and stained
The spirit of the gladiator still
Gives you the strength you need. You are sustained

To prove again that might is right, until
The cup of blood you offer to the grand
Conquistador is drained. He drinks his fill,
Rise up and stand!
