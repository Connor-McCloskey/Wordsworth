The Sun
By Malcolm Guite

I
Birng out the gold in me oh golden sphere
Whose light and splendour none has ever told,
Alchemic archer, brilliant charioteer,
Bring out the gold.

For you were worshipped in the days of old
As bright Apollo. Shine upon me here
And penetrate with light this mortal mould.

Sphere of the poet, prophet, sage and seer,
Lighten my inner eye till truths unfold
And blindness turns to sight. Make all things clear,
Bring out the gold.

II
Bring out the gold and let the deal be done,
For everything at last is bought and sold,
The final tribulation has begun,
Bring out the gold.

Bring in the darkest forces from the cold
And make a show of all we used to shun,
For all the payrolled do as they are told,

And lust for something new under the sun,
And do not care for whom the bell is tolled.
Bring in the day when dreadful things are done,
Bring out the gold.
