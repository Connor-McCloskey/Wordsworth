24
All your hard work will eventually pay off.
Everything lies in silence.
If anything just cannot go wrong, it will anyway.
Nature always sides with the hidden flaw.
Never wear your best pants when fighting for freedom.
Rest is good, but idleness is its brother.
Smile when you're ready.
You cannot fall off the floor.
Your luck is about to change.
I like beans.
You will die on a sea of white sand beneath a black sun.
Stare not into the void. You will not like what stares back.
You think you want that muffin. Don't do it.
There are two people I can't stand in this world: racists, and the Dutch.
A beautiful, smart, and loving person will change your life. It's me.
Wash your hands.
New opportunities will soon come your way.
Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die. Or is it that *you* die? One of the two.
Life needs things to live.
Use some lotion once in a while, dammit!
Run.
No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible.
When the game is done, the pawn and king go into the same box.
No plan survives first contact with the enemy.
