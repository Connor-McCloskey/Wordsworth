Mercury
By Malcolm Guite

I
Quicksilver messenger come flying here
And bring the secret burden that you bear
Your finger to yur lips, a silent seer,
Quicksilver messenger.

Fly through the light of one bright solar flare,
Carry your secret sealed within its sphere,
With every possibility encoded there.

A helix-woven-wand has brought you here
As switft as hidden waves in empty air,
Now loose the lock, and make your meaning clear,
Quicksilver messenger.

II
Quicksilver messenger your lips are sealed
With that dark secret shrouded round in fear
Everything's shadowed, nothing is revealed
Quicksilver messenger.

No one will whisper it, no one will hear,
Doubly occluded, doubly concealed
Behind the firewall of your secret sphere

Whose codes and combinations always shield
The occult and its dark ambassador.
Your message is hermetically sealed
Quicksilver Messenger.
