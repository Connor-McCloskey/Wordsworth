Venus
By Malcolm Guite

I
The morning star is lucent on the hill
To bless our flesh with yearning from afar.
She shines beyond and brightens in us still
The morning star.

All her caresses, soft and tender, are
Like overflowing water at the well,
Like waves that spill themselves onto the shore.

She comes to make us fruitful, to fulfil
The deep desires we shape with her and share
With one another. With her all is well,
The morning star.

II
The monring star, the light that fell to earth,
Infernal Venus, sometime Lucifer,
Whose dark womb brings hte worst in us to birth,
The morning star.

Her tender touch will always leave a scar,
The drowsy murmation of her breath
Floats us away beyond the saving shore

And when we wake with her she drowns us both
Though even as we drown we beg for more.
All her delights deliver us to death,
The morning star.
