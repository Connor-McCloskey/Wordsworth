Earth's Enigmas
By Malcolm Guite

Riddles of the shadowed earth
Open out a hidden path
Tangled in the roots of time
Patterened in an eightfold rhyme
Set against the dark and dread
Cryptic clue and fragile thread,
Sent to those with eyes to see
Guardians of Destiny.

Hidden patterns of the past
Might reclaim what you have lost
Secrets kept by saint and sage
Fragments from the golden age.
Though the darkness comes again
All your hope is not in vain
Seven heavens over earth
Bring that common hope to birth

Night comes when you cannot work
Death-divided in the dark
Left alone you fall and lapse
Crushed within a great collapse
Find each other whilst you can
And your hope is not in vain
Seek within that hidden light
Through whose music you unite

In the darkness, cold, accurst
Where the wasteland does its worst
Loyalty may fail and lapse
Every living truth collapse
All be buried, broken, lost,
Darkened in a dreadful past
Secret seeds may yet escape
Called to kindle of life and hope

Who can see beyond the dark?
Who discern the secret work?
Under moon and sun and star
Seek the one who travels far
From the deepest roots long drawn,
To the city's golden dawn
Quickened life begins to stir,
A long-awaited messenger.

Who can count the ages gone?
Who can hear the hidden song?
Who is he who feels and hears
Long-lost music of the spheres?
Hears the secret symphony
Sevenfold in harmony
Sound present, future, past
Who will hear the call at last?

Far above the city's domes
Seek the traveler when he comes
Even in the blackest night
From the darkness springs a light
Find the end where you begin
Light without and light within
Seek the secret sages know
Light above and light below

Seek in starlight soft and dim
Secrets of the seraphim
Weapons no one else can wield
Patterned on a sacred shield
Where the spheres of heaven shine
Where the elements combine
Where the fearless and the free
Rise to meet their destiny.
