Selenography
after Elizabeth Bradfield's "Whalefall" and Carl Sagan
By Connor McCloskey

They're places few seem to know and fewer have visited:
Tycho, the Sea of Tranquility, the Ocean of Storms,
the plains and hills dotting the Moon. It's the science of

selenography. We've created innumerable maps of the Moon,
and even beyond.

From the haunting gray surfaces of the Moon's Mare Cognitum,
to the wonders of Ishtar Terra and Maat Mons on Venus,
swathed in a dusky orange glow and crushing pressure,
all the way to Mars, where you might see the
mighty mountain of Olympus Mons, somewhere to the far west
of the rust dunes of Meridian Bay.

It was once said that we are natural explorers, mappers,
"drawn by a craving we can hardly articulate or understand."
Perhaps that's why, with every shuttle launch, we see
a bright beacon drift off that we desperately wish we could follow.

We have the maps, and we have our ships ready
to bear us across the endless black gulf over the shining solar wind.
We're ready to dive into Meridian Bay, to climb Maat Mons, to
race across the Ocean of Storms.

We're hungry for adventure, and we'll never be full until
we stand on Olympus Mons and watch the silent blue Martian sunset.
