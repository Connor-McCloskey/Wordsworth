Wordsworth - A Discord Bot

---Change log---
Since I have moved to incremental changes, I will be swapping to version 4 and updating him from there.
Unless I overhaul his core functionality or do some sort of major refractoring, I'll leave him at v.4.X for now.

v.3.0 (4/15/2020) [DONE]
For historical purposes, I'm putting some information here on v.3.0. This version implemented many more functions
(all dice rolling, poetry, jokes, and status updates), user-friendly commands, and went through major refractoring.
For reference, refer to Wordsworth3.0.py and Wordsworth 2.0.py. Point is, 3.0 onward is way better in every way.
