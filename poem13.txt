Saturn
By Malcolm Guite

I
In every heartbreak, wisdom can be found,
The end of things may be the place to start,
The hard frost helps to break the stone ground
In every heart.

Nothing remains the same, things fall apart.
We listen for the music; not a sound.
But we discover, silent and apart,

The meditative minutes circle round,
There is a deeper dance, an inner art,
There is a hidden treasure to be found
In every heart.

II
In every heartbreak he is to be found
He is the end. He makes things fall apart.
There is a prison where his slaves are bound
In every heart.

He crushes hope before we even start
His prisoners must tread the dreary round
Of repitition, lonely and apart.

In him there is no mercy to be found,
No truth, no grace, no beauty and no art,
Only the grave, the cold and stony ground
In every heart.
